Quality * X + Defense * X = Base Cost

Where X = Tough(X) or else X = 1.

6+ = 1pts
5+ = 4pts
4+ = 6pts
3+ = 8pts
2+ = 12pts

=====

Attacks * Range * Quality = Equipment Cost

Melee = 0.25
12” = 0.25
18” = 0.375
24” = 0.5
30” = 0.625
36” = 0.75
42” = 0.875
48” = 1
54" = 1.125
60" = 1.250
66" = 1.375
72" = 1.5

Each 6" is +.125

=====

Only using:

=== not treated as special rules, per se ===
Fast (9" / 18") = Q
Slow (4" / 8") = -Q
===

=== special rules ===

== definite ==
Indirect = weapon cost * 1.25

== later ==
Ambush (deploy later) = Q
Anti-Air: (+1 vs. flyers) = calculate as qualty +0.5
Scout (deployed after all other units, 12" away from enemies) = Q
Sniper (+2 to hit) = calculate per unit quality 2+
Strider (ignore difficult terrain) = Q/2
Stealth (-1 to enemy shooting rolls) = X (where X = Tough(X)*2 or else X = 2)
Flying = Q
Linked (+1 to attack rolls) = calculate at quality -1???

Q Lookup is based on quality:

6+ = 1pts
5+ = 4pts
4+ = 6pts
3+ = 8pts
2+ = 12pts

=====

Weapons:

We're only using straight weapon rules, bigger guns will simply roll
more dice - it's not a "you hit" as much as a "you manage to do X
boxes of damage".

=====

Vehicle effect table (optional)

6 = ammo hit. Kaboom!
5 = random weapon destroyed, else none.
4 = immobilized - stuck for game
3 = stunned - may not move or shoot next turn
2 = shaken - shoot at -1 next turn
1 = no additional effect

Modifiers to target:

Armor facing:

Front: 0
Sides: +1 
Rear: +2

Cover: -1

Reference:

Tough:
 1 = Armored cars
 2 = APC/IFV
 3 = Light tank
 6 = Medium tank
 9 = Heavy tank
12 = Superheavy tank

Infantry weapons are ignored - they don't even hurt armored cars.
 


Rule Suggestions from Kirk:

Calculated Targetting - While you may not know how many
shots it will take to kill an enemy, your crew has a petty good
idea. This model may fire its weapons one at a time and need not
declare its targets ahead of time.

Heavily Armored: This unit reduces the Defense penalty for facing by 1.

For next edition:

Once Grimdark Future v2 drops, add in the new Ambush rules.
