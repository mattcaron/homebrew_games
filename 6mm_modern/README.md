# 6mm Modern

A ruleset based on [OnePageRules](https://onepagerules.com/)'s rules covering Modern (which I broadly define as anything post WWII). It aims to be as simple and fun as the OPR rulesets, and borrows heavily from them, while making some additional modifications beyond those given in the full rulebook.
