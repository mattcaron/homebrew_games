The above was linked off their "free stuff" page for Micro Armor - Modern, here:

True to their motto, it is my opinion that they do indeed make "The Best Damn Wargaming Products" - at least when it comes to their models.

So, use my rules but go buy their models, and thank them for providing the TO&Es, as I am referencing them heavily when determining which pieces of equipment were in use in given time periods.
