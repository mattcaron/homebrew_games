# WEGs

These are all US government publications, unclassified with unrestricted distribution, downloaded over the years.

The WEGs cover foreign weapon systems, are geared towards running an OpFor in military wargames, and therefore are pretty much exactly what we, as wargamers, need.

The WSHs are US weapons systems. They are light on technical detail, but provide a decent background.
