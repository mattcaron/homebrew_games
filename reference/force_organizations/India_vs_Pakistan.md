# India vs. Pakistan notes:

## For India:

In February 2001, the Indian Army signed a contract for 310 T-90S tanks.
124 were completed in Russia and the rest are being delivered in
'knocked down / semi-knocked down' form for final assembly in India.
"The T-90S Russian tank represents an increase in firepower, mobility
and protection."

The first of these was delivered in January 2004. The locally assembled
tanks are christened 'Bhishma'. The tanks are fitted with the Shtora
self-protection system and Catherine thermal imagers from Thales of
France and Peleng of Belarus.

The T-90S gun can also fire the 9M119 Refleks (NATO designation AT-11
Sniper) anti-tank guided missile system. The range of the missile is
100m to 4,000m and takes 11.7 sec to reach maximum range. The system is
intended to engage tanks fitted with ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour) as
well as low-flying air targets such as helicopters, at a range of up to
5km. The missile system fires either the 9M119 or 9M119M missiles which
have semi-automatic laser beamriding guidance and a hollow charge
warhead. Missile weight is 23.4kg. The guns automatic loader will feed
both ordnance and missiles.

## For Pakistan:

- A T-64 or T-74 would work as an Al Khalid / MBT-2000. However, the
Type 69II would probably work better.
- They have many T-80UD's and Chinese Type 85 (which looks similar to
the Type 69)
